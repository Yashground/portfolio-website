              ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I&apos;m Yash, Passionate tech enthusiast, always exploring new innovations in AI and DevOps while enjoying life&apos;s travel adventures with my amazing wife!.
            </p>
            <p>
              <FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> 
              Post my Contract with Microsoft, I decided to move from India to Germany. Here, I found myself immersed into several side projects involving AI and design, which was quite an eye-opener. I realized that programming and math weren&apos;t just two separate entities, they were two sides of the same coin. This understanding ignited my interest in AI integrating it with the DevOps principles I have learnt.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I&apos;m not crunching numbers or coding, you might find me:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><FaPizzaSlice className="inline-block mr-2" /> On a never-ending quest for the perfect pizza recipe</li>
              <li><FaHiking className="inline-block mr-2" /> Exploring new hiking trails (and probably getting lost)</li>
              <li><FaGlobeEurope className="inline-block mr-2" /> or Just in a different European country </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At present, I&apos;m eagerly diving into the deep end of Artificial Intelligence, LLM;s, Sharing content within these fields to educate fellow peers. The intersection of DevOps and AI holds endless possibilities of Robust intelligent applications, and I can&apos;t wait to explore them all. I&apos;m a firm believer in lifelong learning and self-improvement, so I seize every opportunity to learn, regardless of the circumstances. And honestly, making life a tad simpler with these skills - now, isn&apos;t that a fun thought?
